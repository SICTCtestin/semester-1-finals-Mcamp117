    <p>The Banderdex is your home for everything Bandermon</p>
    <h3>How it started</h3>
    <p>Bandermon started as a joke in 2020 but it then turned into an idea to make a video game based on popular Nintendo franchise Pokemon. So me and a couple other kids in my class started making a list of 50 creatures based on jokes with our teachers name and random things that appeared on the board, like an illuminati named charli and 2 people named Jimbob 1 and Jimbob 2.</p>  
    <h3>What is It</h3>
    <p>Bandermon is a game similar to Pokemon, in the sense of how you play, but the story is way darker and more about society. This is because society is literally the villain of the game. </p>
